# myAE - AI Memory System

myAE is a personalized AI Memory System for daily insights and automation, built with Next.js and OpenAI GPT.

## üìå Project Overview

myAE is an AI-powered memory system that uses OpenAI GPT to deliver personalized daily messages and intelligent responses. The architecture is serverless-first, optimized for Vercel, and designed for scalability.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
  - API endpoints located in `src/app/api/[route]/route.ts`
  - Direct support for server-side logic and middleware
  - TypeScript for static typing and better code maintainability
- **AI Integration**: 
  - OpenAI GPT-4-Turbo for core functionality
  - API routes in Next.js for OpenAI requests
  - Claude (only used for development support in Cursor, not integrated in myAE)
- **Memory Layers**:
  - **Short-term**: Upstash Redis (serverless key-value storage)
    - Stores temporary contexts like daily mood or recent AI interactions
    - Data is automatically deleted after a defined period
  - **Long-term**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    - Stores persistent data like user preferences and long-term memory data
    - Open-source Firebase alternative with API support
  - **Semantic**: Pinecone (Vector DB)
    - Stores previous AI interactions as vectors to preserve context over time
    - Uses semantic search to retrieve previous relevant answers
- **Deployment**: Vercel
  - Automatic scaling, no server management
  - Direct GitHub integration for continuous deployment
  - Native Next.js support (no manual configuration needed)
- **DNS & CDN**: Cloudflare

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built with a serverless-first approach:

### API Routes

- **Next.js API routes for OpenAI integration**
  - `/api/gpt` ‚Äì Communicates with OpenAI GPT
  - Uses `fetch` for OpenAI API calls
  - Returns JSON responses with `NextResponse.json()`

#### Example API Usage

**POST Request to `/api/gpt`:**

```json
{
  "prompt": "How does Bitcoin work?"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "result": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency system..."
}
```

### Memory System

- **Three-tiered memory system**:
  - Short-term (Redis): For temporary context and recent interactions
  - Long-term (PostgreSQL): For persistent user data and preferences
  - Semantic (Vector DB): For context-aware retrieval of past interactions

### Environment Variables

- **Stored in Vercel ‚Üí Environment Variables**
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Üí API key for OpenAI
  - `APP_ENV` ‚Üí "production" or "development"

### Extensibility

- **Email Service**: Resend API / Postmark for daily emails
  - Generates personalized content from OpenAI API
  - Content based on stored preferences from memory layer
- **Telegram Integration** (future): 
  - Possibility to connect a Telegram bot that uses myAE's AI functionality
  - API routes could receive requests via Telegram and generate responses
- **Web Frontend** (optional):
  - Dashboard in Next.js for managing memory data and personalizing AI responses

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your API keys
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üì¶ Dependencies

- `@upstash/redis`: For short-term memory storage
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: For long-term memory storage
- `@pinecone-database/pinecone`: For semantic memory storage
- `eventsource-parser`: For streaming OpenAI responses

## üö¢ Deployment & DevOps

### GitHub ‚Üí Vercel Deployment Pipeline

- Code stored in a private GitHub repository
- Vercel detects commits & automatically builds new versions
- Branch protection for main to prevent unwanted changes

### CI/CD Automation

- GitHub Actions (future possibility) for tests & QA before deployments
- Logging & monitoring via Vercel Logs

## üí° Use Cases

- **Daily Personalized Messages**: Receive AI-generated insights based on your preferences and past interactions
- **Memory-Enhanced Responses**: AI responses that remember your previous conversations and preferences
- **Multi-Channel Access**: Access your AI memory system via email, Telegram (future), or web interface

## üîñ Next Steps

- Optimize the API route `/api/gpt` further
- Memory integration with Supabase/Pinecone as the next milestone
- First live tests with API requests and OpenAI response tuning
- Implement email notification system
- Develop Telegram bot integration
