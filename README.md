# myAE - AI Memory System

myAE is a personalized AI Memory System for daily insights and automation, built with Next.js and OpenAI GPT.

## 📌 Project Overview

myAE is an AI-powered memory system that uses OpenAI GPT to deliver personalized daily messages and intelligent responses. The architecture is serverless-first, optimized for Vercel, and designed for scalability.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
  - API endpoints located in `src/app/api/[route]/route.ts`
  - Direct support for server-side logic and middleware
  - TypeScript for static typing and better code maintainability
- **AI Integration**: 
  - OpenAI GPT-4-Turbo for core functionality
  - API routes in Next.js for OpenAI requests
  - Claude (only used for development support in Cursor, not integrated in myAE)
- **Memory Layers**:
  - **Short-term**: Upstash Redis (serverless key-value storage)
    - Stores temporary contexts like daily mood or recent AI interactions
    - Data is automatically deleted after a defined period
  - **Long-term**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    - Stores persistent data like user preferences and long-term memory data
    - Open-source Firebase alternative with API support
  - **Semantic**: Pinecone (Vector DB)
    - Stores previous AI interactions as vectors to preserve context over time
    - Uses semantic search to retrieve previous relevant answers
- **Deployment**: Vercel
  - Automatic scaling, no server management
  - Direct GitHub integration for continuous deployment
  - Native Next.js support (no manual configuration needed)
- **DNS & CDN**: Cloudflare

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built with a serverless-first approach:

- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for OpenAI integration
  - `/api/gpt` – Communicates with OpenAI GPT
  - Uses `fetch` for OpenAI API calls
  - Returns JSON responses with `NextResponse.json()`
- **Memory System**: Three-tiered memory system (short-term, long-term, semantic)
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Stored in Vercel → Environment Variables
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` → API key for OpenAI
  - `APP_ENV` → "production" or "development"
- **Extensibility**: 
  - **Email Service**: Resend API / Postmark for daily emails
    - Generates personalized content from OpenAI API
    - Content based on stored preferences from memory layer
  - **Telegram Integration** (future): 
    - Possibility to connect a Telegram bot that uses myAE's AI functionality
    - API routes could receive requests via Telegram and generate responses
  - **Web Frontend** (optional):
    - Dashboard in Next.js for managing memory data and personalizing AI responses

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your API keys
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## 📦 Dependencies

- `@upstash/redis`: For short-term memory storage
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: For long-term memory storage
- `@pinecone-database/pinecone`: For semantic memory storage
- `eventsource-parser`: For streaming OpenAI responses

## 🚢 Deployment & DevOps

- **GitHub → Vercel Deployment Pipeline**:
  - Code stored in a private GitHub repository
  - Vercel detects commits & automatically builds new versions
  - Branch protection for main to prevent unwanted changes
- **CI/CD Automation**:
  - GitHub Actions (future possibility) for tests & QA before deployments
  - Logging & monitoring via Vercel Logs

## 🔖 Next Steps

- Optimize the API route `/api/gpt` further
- Memory integration with Supabase/Pinecone as the next milestone
- First live tests with API requests and OpenAI response tuning
